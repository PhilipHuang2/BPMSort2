# BPM Sorter Synopsis
This is a simple application that asks the user to see their spotify playlist using the 
Spotify API and sort their songs by BPM(beats per minutes).  Then it creates one playlist for the user using based on 1 BPM.

# Important Imports 
## Spotipy
The python library to access the Spotify API, essential to the project and simplify the call I send to the API.
## PYSimpleGUI
A GUI Library I used to create the front end for this project and guides the user through process.
## Webbrowser
The Authentication method I use for the Spotify API is the Authorization Code Flow which opens up a web page for the user
to input into the program to allow permission into your Spotify Playlist.  Webbrowser is the way I open up the page in 
your browser.
